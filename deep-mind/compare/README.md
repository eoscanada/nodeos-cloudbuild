Compare run
-----------

* This process takes the block logs produced by the `boot` step
* Replays it and outputs the traces to `output.log`
* Compares it to `reference.log`

Updating the traces
-------------------

After you've inspected any difference, update the `reference.log` by
copying `output.log` over it.
